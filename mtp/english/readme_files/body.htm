<br>Mazzy gets a quest, involving the possibility of becoming a paladin. It isn't still complete, since all the banters and other dialogue of Mazzy still think that she is the usual BioWare figher.
<br>Q: Why should I use this mod instead of the excellent Level 1 NPCs provided by GB?
<br>A: Three reasons. The first is that I provide a quest, full with with new fights and colourful encounters, while GB flat-changes the class. Second, mine is a WeiDU install, and as such I won't overwrite anything important. Third, Mazzy's weapons get improved two times, so now they make sense.
<br>Q: Why should I use the excellent Level 1 NPCs provided by GB instead of this mod?
<br>A: Three reasons. First: GB's mod provides similar choiches for almost all BioWare NPCs. Second: they are level 1, so that you can choose their weapons Proficiencies as fit. Third: they are in their new class from when you get them, not after a quest.

<a name="install"><font size=+3><b> 2. Installation and uninstallation</b><br></font>
<p>It's <b>not</b> the same as most WeiDU mods, since you have to check some stuff manually!
<br>You should obtain and install the latest SOA or TOB patch from <a href="http://www.interplay.com">Interplay</a> or <a href=http://www.bioware.com>Bioware</a> BEFORE installing any of these components.
<br>After that, get the last Baldurash post-patch Fix Pack from <a href="http://www.baldurdash.org" Target=_blank>Baldurdash</a>
<BR><BR>Do I really need to explain how WeiDU works? I hope not ;-)

<a name="bugs"><font size=+3><b>3. Known bugs and incompatibility problems</b></font>
<p><font size=+2>(In)Compatibility:</font><br>
<br><font size=+1><i>Mazzy</i></font>
<br>Some scripts in the mod require that Detectable Spells is installed in order to work properly. You can get somewhat near here <a href=http://home.earthlink.net/~cirerrek/>Cirrerek's main page</a>. The mod will install properly also without it, but it won't run at 100%. Please also note that many mods (to name a few: Ascension, Kelsey, Kiara/Zayia, Spell 50, Oversight - Tougher Sendai) already provide Detectable spells, so 90% of the times this won't be a major problem.
<br>Alas, this would mean that the Stupid Script of Dissaster (you know what I mean, eheheh) won't run properly. Another good reason to uninstall it.
<br><font size=+1><i>Mazzy</i></font>
<br>I experienced some problems with the kit-changing code which is causated by Oversight - cleric kits bad coding. I try to fix stuff on my own part, though.
<br><br>
<font size=+2>Known Bugs or other in-game problems:</font><br>
<br><font size=+1><i>Mazzy</i></font>
<br>If you use the anti-undead scroll before talking to the lich, he won't talk to you. Cause: the scroll makes you immune to him. Solution: use the scroll after talking, or eventually use it on everybody but one party member, who will use it after having done the chitchat.
<br><br>If you smell something wrong with another mod, or post at <a href=http://forums.forgottenwars.net/index.php?showforum=167>my forum</a>, and I will do anything possible to fix it, or will warn people in the readme.<br>

<a name="thankyou"><font size=+3><b>4. Thank you</b></font><br>
DEVELOPER:
<br>Valerio Bigiani (The Bigg)
<br>
<br>MISC THANKS:
<br>
<br>-   Weimer, for explaining me the whole ~"% thing in WeiDU. Alas… Had I learned it the day before, I wouldn't have changed manually all the " in the 20 pages of .d in alt+0126 (a.k.a. ~). Oh yes, nearly forgetting: WeiDU was necessary to do this MOD; in particular I want to thank him for the STR_CMP function. I originally asked it for the Refinements, but it's proving even more useful than I believed (at least to me).
<br>-   T.G.Maestro, for indirectly having hinted to me that I could be a decent MODder, and for lending me a file for the sake of the Mprolla component.
<br>-   A certain "Gulliard" for providing false identity to Mprilla at my forums, and bringing some useless spam to it.
<br>-   Galactycon, for allowing me to use his own Imprisonment fix instead of my, worse, one. Also, a very helpful insight for editing seagulls.
<br>-   Icelus, for kindly hosting my mod.
<br>-   TheWizard, for additional hosting.
<br>-   Littiz, for helping me with the kit.ids patching, whom, in his turn, copyed Dyara's work.
<br>-   Cirrerek, who allowed me to insert portions of Detectable & Scriptable Spells, for optimal work and scripting.
<br><br> Joe B, for being the first person to report a bug ;)
<br><br> Ohter people who reported bugs by e-mail, so I'm not sure about the nicknames:
<br>-   Mathias Jakobsen
<br><br> Ronny Mo encouraged a large re-make of the Mazzy component
<br>
<br>IDEAS BLATANTLY STOLEN:
<br>Robin, Ted Sandy and the ShireGuards are inspired from LotR.
<br>Gyron, Phaladriel, Lorun and Merik are joinable NPC from that [not good] game that is called Dungeon Siege. I just borrowed the names.
<br>Many scripts and dialogues have a large (Creative, mind you, not blatantly dumb) copy/paste section from other people's (mainly, tougher mages from the Tactics mod made by Westley Weimer <a href=http://www.weidu.org>www.weidu.org</a>).
<br>In case you haven't noticed, Surenici is Irenicus spelled backwards. Also, the "Cowled Thieves" stand as a proof of my big, creative fantasy with names.
<br>
<br>DEDICATED TO:
<br><font size=+5><b><u>This Mod is dedicated to the memory of Luca Poli</u></font></b>, a schoolmate and big friend of mine who had committed suicide on February 2004, the 13th.
<br><font size=+5><u>You never died really in my heart.</u></font><br><br>
<font size=-1> (Some dialogues in the mod are directly inspired to him, namely the "sad story" of the lich dialogue). To see this dialogue, select, during the first talk with the lich, 3, 2, 1 and 1.</font>

Since they have released it before me, I bowed down and let them keep the reservation (their code cannot be easily made compatible with mine).

<a name="versions"><font size=+3><b>6. Version history</b></font>
<br><u>New changes:</u>:
<br>Probably commented/solved some bug.
<br>Ready for adoption.
<br><br><u>Changes when it was in tb#pack</u>:
<br> Started Adding Stivan the Hunter to the mix.
<br>WeiDU v161. Among general improvements, bugfixes and whatnot, the STR_CMP function is giving me a HUUUUUUGE help in patching most files. For example, it allows me to modify the items that Stivan is already carrying without having to copy directly the creature.
<br>Include Scriptable Spells, sometimes uses Detectable Spells... Kudos to Cirrerek for permission.
<br><br>Mazzy the Paladin: these are Ronny Mo induced changes:
<br>- Now Mazzy's portrait will update correctly.
<br>- Major dialogue enhancing (remove stupid meta-content in favor of pragmatic dialogues, complete rewriting of Lich's sequence, some bug-fixes).
<br>- You can't kill an idle Terrasque before talking to the Lich.
 <br>- Will update Mazzy's in-party dialogue and all (EG interjections, banters and watnot). (only partly done)
<br> Other revamps to MtP, self-inducted.
<br>  You can fight the lich also if not going to be a paladin, the plot changes only when you talk to Arvoreen.
<br>  Removed Anomen conflict.
<br>  Removed Dakkon's cameo. My cameo plot was a plain rape to Planescape.
<p><u>Changes since when it was called Mazzy the Paladin<u> (now it's mtp):
<p>Version 6, dated 07th July 2004:
<br>No longer a Beta. Hopefully more people will try this ;).
<br>Uses TRA files.
<br>Uses more folders, instead of listing manually 20+ files in the tp2.
<br>Really use blank files.
<br>Surenici's Simulacrums and Image now should die with the appropriate spells (that is, unless they casted the right Spell Immunity ;) which they often do :-( ).
<br><br>Version BETA 5, dated 27th June 2004:
<br>Minor tweaks to the readme.
<br>Sauron's ring no longer gives 20 round mislead, but instead only Improved Invisibility.
<br>The Annoying Spells fix is now broken in three components.
<br>Changed my own Imprisonment fix to the much better Galactycon's one.
<br>Added the TOB Surenici showdown. He rocks.
<br>Blank files to detect my components:
<br>- tb#mazpa.txt for Mazzy the Paladin
<br>- tb#impri.spl for the Imprisonment Fix
<br>- tb#dropw.txt for the Drop Weapons In Panic removing
<br>- tb#natbe.txt for the Nature Beauty tweak
<br><br>Version BETA 4, dated 6th June 2004:
<br>DIsplaying correct strings when weapons are upgraded to the second Paladin version.
<br>Modena is explored as it should now...
<br>added the Kits.ids fix (only for the paladin kits). It used to be screwed up. Thanks to Littiz for having allowed me to "steal his work" (which, in turn, is a WeiDU translation of Dyara's changes).
<br>Trying even harded to implement the kit changing...
<br>Older Sword and Bow of Arvoreen get removed when receiving the first "paladin" version...
<br>Aledreth now has a chance of stealing the Ring of Sauron, and will do so anyway after the last battle (the one with 9 thieves).
<br>Small change in Aledreth's thieves spawning.
<br>Imprisonment Fix: now corrects the int of all creatures that exceed 24 either naturally or through potions (Mordy - sword01.cre had 30 int, while Kuirosan - solak1.cre had 17 int + 3 potions of Mind Focusing)
<br>Imprisonment Fix: Typ0 that prevented items without extension header to work. Thanks to Joe B for the report and for having sent the problematic file.
<br><br>Version BETA 3, dated 5th June 2004:
<br>Tweaked slightly the Lich buffs, with the Cavaliers in mind (no Mirror Images, so that the sword will do its job right now)
<br>Now you don't have to kill the Taraque, he "disappears" if the Lich dies. But.. you'll lose 107.000 XP!
<br>Aledreth is now immune to ADHW or similar cheese tactics. He used some more potions in buffing up ;-)
<br>The Shiresguards will disappear after Robin is safe.
<br>Before the class changes, I drop your equipment, so that you won't lose the weapon you had in slot # 4. Learned the hard way ;-)
<br>Small change in the Mayor dialogue, now he tells you that Arvoreen's weapons have been upgraded.
<br>Reduced the "Click Continue" syndrome of my dialogues (not completely solved, but it's better than before). While I was there, I reduced the stupidity of a certain block of the Lich.
<br>Fix in case of force-attack on Gyron
<br>ADDED FEATURE:
<br>Added the Imprisonment fix. It will help against the Tarasque, methinks.
<br><br>Version BETA 2, dated 4th June 2004:
<br>A lot of stupid fixes that I forgot to discover, in the hurry of releasing the mod (Let's say that this is the real V1, heh...):
<br>Small typo that prevented the mod to ever start >:-(
<br>Dak'kon should now spawn as intended.
<br>Ted Sandy is cured of his paralysis >:-<
<br>Robin renamed from "Robin Tanabuca" (Italian) to "Robin Smallburrow" (English).
<br>Can now rest in the "town".
<br>In the map, you'll see markers to show where guys of interest are.
<br>Self-extracting RAR, to help a frined of mine who can't get WinRAR to work...
<br><br>Version BETA, 1 dated 3rd June 2004:
<br>First Version. Didn't work at all :-(
